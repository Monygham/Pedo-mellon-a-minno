For reader's convenience we recall few notions.

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a topological space and let $f:X \ra \RR$ be a function. Then $f$ is \textit{lower-semicontinuous} if for every $r \in \RR$ the set
$$\{x\in X\,|\,f(x) \leq r \}$$
is closed. We say that $f$ is \textit{upper-semicontinuous} if $-f$ is lower-semicontinuous.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a convex subset of a linear space over $\RR$ and let $f:X \ra \RR$ be a function. Then $f$ is \textit{convex} if for every $x_1, x_2\in X$ and $t\in [0,1]$ we have
$$f\left(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2\right)\leq tf(x_1) + (1-t)f(x_2)$$
We say that $f$ is \textit{concave} if $-f$ is convex.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a convex subset of a linear space over $\RR$ and let $f:X \ra \RR$ be a function. Then $f$ is \textit{quasiconvex} if for every $x_1, x_2\in X$ and $t\in [0,1]$ we have
$$f\left(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2\right) \leq \max\big\{f(x_1),f(x_2)\big\}$$
We say that $f$ is \textit{quasiconcave} if $-f$ is quasiconvex.
\end{definition}

\begin{fact}\label{fact:conveximpliesquasiconvex}
Every convex function is quasiconvex.
\end{fact}
\begin{proof}
We left the proof to the reader.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{proposition:characterizationofquasiconvexity}
Let $X$ be a convex subset of a linear space over $\RR$. Suppose that $f:X \ra \RR$ is a function. Then the following are equivalent.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{\textbf{(\arabic*)}}, leftmargin=1.5em]
\item $f$ is quasiconvex.
\item For every $r \in \RR$ the set $\{x\in X\,|\,f(x)\leq r\}$ is convex.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
We prove $\textbf{(1)}\Rightarrow \textbf{(2)}$. Pick $r \in \RR$, $x_1,x_2\in X$ and assume that $f(x_1), f(x_2)$ are both less or equal to $r$. Then
$$f\left(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2\right) \leq \max\big\{f(x_1),f(x_2)\big\} \leq r$$
for every $t\in [0,1]$ by \textbf{(1)}. Thus the set $\{x\in X\,|\,f(x)\leq r\}$ contains line segment joining $x_1$ with $x_2$ and hence it is convex. This is \textbf{(2)}.\\
We prove $\textbf{(2)}\Rightarrow \textbf{(1)}$. Pick $x_1,x_2\in X$ and $t\in [0,1]$. Let $r = \max\big\{f(x_1), f(x_2)\big\}$. Then by \textbf{(2)} we deduce that the set $\{x\in X\,|\,f(x)\leq r\}$ is convex. Hence $f\left(tx_1 + (1-t)x_2\right)\leq r$. This shows \textbf{(1)}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Sion's theorem]\label{theorem:sionsminimax}
Let $X$ be a convex, compact subset of a topological vector space over $\RR$ and let $Y$ be a convex subset of a topological vector space over $\RR$. Suppose that $f:X\times Y\ra \RR$ is a function such that the following assertions hold.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{\textbf{(\arabic*)}}, leftmargin=1.5em]
\item $f_x$ is upper-semicontinuous and quasiconcave for every $x$ in $X$.
\item $f_y$ is lower-semicontinuous and quasiconvex for every $y$ in $Y$.
\end{enumerate}
Then we have
$$\inf_{x\in X}\sup_{y\in Y}f(x,y) = \sup_{y\in Y}\inf_{x\in X}f(x,y)$$
\end{theorem}
\noindent
For every $y\in Y$ and $r \in \RR$ we denote
$$L_{f,r,y} = \big\{x\in X\,\big|\,f(x,y)\leq r \big\}$$
Note that for each $r\in \RR$ the family $\{L_{f,r,y}\}_{y\in Y}$ consists of convex, compact subsets of $X$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:finiteintersectionsionslemma}
Let $X$ be a convex, compact subset of a topological vector space over $\RR$ and let $Y$ be a convex subset of a topological vector space over $\RR$. Suppose that $f:X\times Y\ra \RR$ is a function such that the following assertions hold.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\emph{\textbf{(\arabic*)}}, leftmargin=1.5em]
\item $f_x$ is upper-semicontinuous and quasiconcave for every $x$ in $X$.
\item $f_y$ is lower-semicontinuous and quasiconvex for every $y$ in $Y$.
\end{enumerate}
For every $y\in Y$ and $r \in \RR$ we denote
$$L_{f,r,y} = \big\{x\in X\,\big|\,f(x,y)\leq r \big\}$$
If a family $\{L_{f,r,y}\}_{y\in Y}$ consists of nonempty sets, then it admits finite intersection property.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof of the lemma]
For any such $X, Y$ and $f$ pick $r\in \RR$ such that $L_{f,r,y}$ is nonempty for every $y$ in $Y$. Suppose that $y_1,...,y_{m}$ are points in $Y$. We want to show that
$$\bigcap_{i=1}^{m}L_{f,r,y_i} \neq \emptyset$$
Consider $X' = L_{f,r,y_{m}}$. This is a convex, compact and nonempty subset of a topological vector space over $\RR$. Next let $f':X'\times Y\ra \RR$ be the restriction of $f$. Then
$$L_{f',r,y} = X' \cap L_{f,r,y} = L_{f,r,y_{m}} \cap L_{f,r,y}$$
and it suffices to prove that
$$\bigcap_{i=1}^{m-1} L_{f',r,y_i} \neq \emptyset$$
Hence the proof goes on induction on $m$ provided that we prove first that $L_{f,r,y_1}\cap L_{f,r,y_2}\neq \emptyset$ for any $y_1, y_2\in Y$ and every $X, Y, f$ and $r\in \RR$ such that the family $\{L_{f,r,y}\}_{y\in Y}$ consists of nonempty sets. Assume by contradiction that $L_{f,r,y_1}\cap L_{f,r,y_2} = \emptyset$. Suppose that $y\in [y_1,y_2]$ and $x\in L_{f,r,y}$. Since $f_x$ is quasiconcave, we derive that
$$\min\{f(x,y_1),f(x,y_2)\} \leq f(x,y) \leq r$$
and hence $x\in L_{f,r,y_1}\cup L_{f,r,y_2}$. This implies that for every $y\in [y_1,y_2]$ we have $L_{f,r,y} \subseteq L_{,fr,y_1}\cup L_{f,r,y_2}$. Since sets $L_{f,r,y_1}, L_{f,r,y_2}$ are disjoint, we deduce that either $L_{f,r,y}\subseteq L_{f,r,y_1}$ or $L_{f,r,y}\subseteq L_{f,r,y_2}$ for every $y\in Y$. Now we define
$$F_1 = \big\{y\in [y_1,y_2]\,\big|\,L_{f,r,y}\subseteq L_{f,r,y_1}\big\},\,F_2 = \big\{y\in [y_1,y_2]\,\big|\,L_{f,r,y}\subseteq L_{f,r,y_2}\big\}$$
We proved that $F_1\cup F_2 = [y_1,y_2]$ and $F_1\cap F_2 = \emptyset$. Next fix $i = 1,2$ and suppose that $\{z_n\}_{n\in \NN}$ is a sequence of points in $F_1$ convergent to some point $z\in [y_1,y_2]$. Pick $x\in L_{f,r,z}$. Since $f_x$ is upper-semicontinuous, we have
$$\limsup_{n\ra +\infty}f(x,z_n) \leq f(x,z)\leq r$$
Thus there exists $n\in \NN$ such that $f(x,z_n)\leq r$. This implies that $x\in L_{f,r,y_i}$ and hence $L_{f,r,z}$ intersects with $L_{f,r,y_i}$. Therefore, we deduce that $L_{f,r,z}\subseteq L_{f,r,y_i}$. This implies that $z\in F_i$. Hence $F_1, F_2$ are closed subsets of $[y_1,y_2]$, which are disjoint and with union equal to $[y_1,y_2]$. This is contradiction with the fact that $[y_1,y_2]$ is connected. This proves that $L_{f,r,y_1}\cap L_{f,r,y_2}\neq \emptyset$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of the theorem]
We always have
$$\sup_{y\in Y}\inf_{x\in X}f(x,y)\leq \inf_{x\in X}\sup_{y\in Y}f(x,y)$$
Next pick $r\in \RR$ such that
$$\sup_{y\in Y}\inf_{x\in X}f(x,y) < r$$
Then $\{L_{f,r,y}\}_{y\in Y}$ consists of nonempty and compact subsets of $X$. By Lemma \ref{lemma:finiteintersectionsionslemma} we deduce that $\{L_{f,r,y}\}_{y\in Y}$ admits finite intersection property. Hence there exists $x$ in $X$ such that
$$x\in \bigcap_{y\in Y}L_{f,r,y}$$
Therefore, $f(x,y)\leq r$ for every $y\in Y$. This implies that
$$\inf_{x\in X}\sup_{y\in Y}f(x,y)\leq \sup_{y\in Y}f(x,y)\leq r$$
This shows that
$$\inf_{x\in X}\sup_{y\in Y}f(x,y) \leq \sup_{y\in Y}\inf_{x\in X}f(x,y)$$
\end{proof}
