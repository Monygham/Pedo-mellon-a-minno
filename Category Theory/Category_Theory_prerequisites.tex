\title{Category Theory - prerequisites}
\date{}
\maketitle
\noindent
Here we discuss prerequisites for notes in this directory. The classical book \cite{Maclane} is a standard reference for categories. Book \cite{freyd1962abelian} concerns abelian categories. Among many usefull results and interesting exercises it also contains the proof of the celebrated Freyd-Mitchell theorem. The article \cite{grothendieck1957} is another standard work on abelian categories. It was written in order to provide a general framework for homological algebra. We refer to the specific parts of these three sources when needed.
