\title{Algebraic Geometry - prerequisites}
\date{}
\maketitle
\noindent
Here we discuss prerequisites for notes in this directory. The classical book \cite{Maclane} contains presentation of category theory. Topological notions that we need can be found in the very first chapters of monograph \cite{engelking1989general}. For commutative algebra we recommend excellent book \cite{AtiyahMacdonald}. We also use some facts from the field of homological algebra. For this we recommend the reader of our notes to look in relevant parts of \cite{weibel1995introduction}. Exhaustive and excellent introduction to the language of schemes is \cite{EGA1new}. The reader may want first to confer \cite{eisenbud2000geometryofschemes}, which does not cover the same amount of material but explains important intuitions behind abstract concepts.
